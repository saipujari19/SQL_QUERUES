Description: 	
	Analyzing the BirthData table in the Births database performing data transformation. It starts with 
    altering column types, moving date information to a new column and then, deleting the old column. 
    The script then runs several analytical queries to understand the birthsâ€™ count along with states, 
    year, month and specific date values.
